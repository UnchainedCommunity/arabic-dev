# Alkhalil Morpho Sys  
Alkhalil Morpho Sys is a morphosyntactic parser of Arabic words. The system can process non vocalized texts as well as partially or totally vocalized ones. As an output of the analysis, we have a highly informative table mainly containing vocalization of the stem, its grammatical category, its possible roots associated with corresponding patterns, proclitics and enclitics.
